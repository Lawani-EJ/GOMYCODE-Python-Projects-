# Week 2 Checkpoint - GOMYCODE
This repository contains solutions to various Python programming tasks assigned for Week 2. 
Below is an overview of each task, explaining what the program does and how it works.

## üìù Task Overview
### 1. Multiply All Items in a List
**Description:** This program multiplies all the elements in a list to produce the product. It demonstrates how to use built-in functions to perform mathematical operations on lists.

### 2. Sort a List of Tuples by the Last Element
**Description:** The program sorts a list of tuples in increasing order based on the last element of each tuple. It showcases how to customize the sorting behavior using a `lambda` function.

### 3. Combine Two Dictionaries by Adding Values for Common Keys
**Description:** This program merges two dictionaries by adding values for keys that appear in both dictionaries. It results in a combined dictionary where common keys have their values summed up.

### 4. Sort a Tuple List by the Float Element
**Description:** Sorts a list of tuples based on their float values in descending order. This demonstrates how to convert string values to float for sorting purposes.

### 5. Working with Sets in Python
**Description:** This program covers basic set operations, including creating a set, iterating through its elements, adding new members, and removing existing items. It‚Äôs a practical demonstration of how to manipulate sets in Python.
