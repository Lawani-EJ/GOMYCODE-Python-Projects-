# Error Handling and Debugging in Python üêçüîç
This repository is a collection of examples demonstrating common errors in Python, how to identify them, and ways to handle them properly. It aims to help developers understand different types of errors, debug code effectively, and implement proper error-handling techniques.

## üìú Overview

The following error types are covered:

1. **Syntax Error**: These occur when there is a problem with the structure of the code, such as a missing quotation mark or unmatched parentheses. The Python parser will be unable to interpret the code and will raise an error.

2. **Key Error**: This error arises when attempting to access a dictionary with a key that does not exist. It indicates that the specified key is not available in the dictionary.

3. **Indentation Error**: Python relies on indentation to determine the structure of code blocks. If the code is not indented properly, this error will be triggered.

4. **StopIteration Error**: Raised when the `next()` function is called on an iterator that has no more items. It indicates that the iteration has reached the end.

5. **Type Error**: This occurs when an operation is performed on a data type that does not support it, such as adding an integer to a string.

6. **Value Error**: Raised when a function receives an argument of the correct data type but with an inappropriate value. For example, attempting to convert a non-numeric string to an integer.

7. **Name Error**: This error arises when referencing a variable that has not been defined. It indicates that the name used is not recognized by the Python interpreter.

8. **ZeroDivisionError**: This error occurs when a number is divided by zero, which is mathematically undefined. The program will raise an exception to indicate the issue.

## üìö Learning Outcomes

- Recognize different error types that can occur in Python programming.
- Understand the causes behind common errors.
- Learn effective techniques for debugging and resolving these errors.
- Use error-handling techniques such as `try-except` blocks to manage runtime issues.

## üîß Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
2. **Explore Examples**: Review the examples provided for each type of error and understand the causes behind them.
3. **Practice Error Handling**: Try introducing deliberate errors in the code and use error-handling techniques to fix them.
4. **Modify the Code**: Experiment with different scenarios and observe how error handling can help prevent crashes.

## ü§ù Contributions

Contributions to the project are welcome! You can add more examples of different errors, suggest improvements, or share your own error-handling tips.
